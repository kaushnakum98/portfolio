            <p>
              when the pandemic started and my classes were online, and I was not doing any part-time job so I had extra time on my hand and I took this opportunity to learn React.

one day I saw the post about react project ideas on Instagram and I was comfortable enough to apply my knowledge and develop my first react web application(considering building a to-do application does not count ðŸ˜›).

developing this project alongside learning new concepts as react lifecycles, hooks, ES6 was challenging in the starting phase, but I'm glad that i stuck with it and built the application.

I started this project with class-based components, later switched to functional components as realized that a functional component is written shorter and simpler, which makes it easier to develop, understand, and test. Class components can also be confusing with so many uses of this. Using functional components can easily avoid this kind of a mess and keep everything clean.

selecting the perfect API for different data was a bit challenging task for me as I had to change API endpoints time by time when one does not work.

I had selected ChartJs npm library to show charts and inject data into it from public APIs, for design I had used Material Ui from google and a few Styled-Components.

This project helped to solidify a lot of my React knowledge, such as using hooks or updating the states. I also got a lot of great practice using ES6+ syntax across the entirety of the project.
